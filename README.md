## üéÆ Discovery Methods

### Method 1: ü•∑ Ultra-Stealth Discovery
**Purpose**: Maximum stealth for penetration testing and red team operations
- **Decoy Strategy**: Intelligent decoy IP generation based on network topology
- **Timing**: T1 template with randomized delays (0.5-2.0s)
- **Evasion**: Packet fragmentation, MAC spoofing, TTL randomization
- **Detection Avoidance**: Randomized host order, variable packet sizes

```bash
# Network configuration automatically applied:
# - 3 smart decoy IPs per scan
# - Random MAC addresses
# - Fragmented packets (-f)
# - Custom TTL values (32-64 range)
# - Randomized data lengths (16-48 bytes)
```

### Method 2: ‚ö° Fast Optimized Discovery
**Purpose**: Network administration and quick reconnaissance
- **Speed Focus**: T4 timing template with high parallelization
- **Efficiency**: Multi-probe discovery (ICMP + TCP ACK to common ports)
- **Reliability**: Smart timeout management and retry logic
- **Performance**: 10-50 parallel hosts with optimized resource usage

### Method 3: üîç Stealth + Port Discovery
**Purpose**: Comprehensive stealth reconnaissance with service identification
- **Two-Phase Approach**: Stealth host discovery followed by SYN port scanning
- **Service Detection**: Scans common ports (22,23,25,53,80,110,135,139,443,445,993,995,1723,3389,5900)
- **Stealth Maintained**: Continues evasion techniques during port scanning
- **Detailed Results**: Host information with open port enumeration

### Method 4: üîç Fast + Port Discovery
**Purpose**: Quick comprehensive network mapping
- **Rapid Assessment**: Fast host discovery with immediate port scanning
- **Connect Scanning**: TCP connect scans for reliable service detection
- **High Throughput**: Parallel processing across multiple hosts
- **Administrative Focus**: Optimized for network management tasks

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Core Components

**Dependency Management System**
- Automatic detection of package managers across Linux distributions
- Intelligent installation of missing tools with proper error handling
- Network connectivity verification before attempting installations
- Fallback mechanisms for unsupported package managers

**Update Management**
- GitHub API integration for version checking
- Semantic versioning comparison with proper parsing
- Automatic backup creation before updates
- Rollback capability in case of update failures
- Silent update checks for background monitoring

**Stealth Engine**
- **Smart Decoy Algorithm**: Generates decoys that blend with network topology
  - 70% probability for nearby IPs (realistic traffic patterns)
  - 30% probability for random IPs (noise generation)
  - Avoids common gateway, broadcast, and multicast ranges
- **Timing Randomization**: Uses bc for precise floating-point delays
- **MAC Spoofing**: Generates locally administered MAC addresses
- **Packet Manipulation**: Variable TTL, data length, and fragmentation

**Discovery Engine**
- **XML Processing**: Robust parsing with xmllint for accurate results
- **Fallback Parsing**: Grep/sed patterns when xmllint unavailable
- **Result Validation**: Multiple verification steps for discovered hosts
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time statistics and timing analysis

### Network Intelligence

**Topology Awareness**
The tool analyzes target network ranges to generate realistic decoy traffic that mimics legitimate network scanning patterns. This approach significantly reduces detection probability by blending reconnaissance traffic with normal network activity.

**Adaptive Scanning**
Based on network responsiveness and target characteristics, the tool automatically adjusts scanning parameters including parallelization levels, timeout values, and probe frequencies to optimize both speed and stealth.
